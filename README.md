# go-mysql-insert
This is a basic go application source code, which reads data from a csv file and stores it into MySQL database

First, I have created a CSV file containing 4 columns and 24 rows.

Then I wrote a Go program to open and read that csv file and save the data in the MySQL databse which I have connected in it.

And to make sure that we read the data from csv file,
I am also printing the data right after reading from the csv file.

At the end, I am fetching the data and displaying from the database in which we saved data right now, 
just to make sure it correctly saved in the database.

Thank you!
